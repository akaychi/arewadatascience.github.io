    "text": "ArewaDS Application is Open\nThe Arewa Data Science Fellowship application is open. The Arewa Data Science fellowship (ADSF) provides an opportunity to learn from data scientists and machine learning experts. The fellowship is a 16-week-long free training that provides a hands-on approach to data science, machine learning and deep learning.\nThe skills and knowledge acquired during the fellowship will help participants pursue careers in data science, machine learning and research. Our goal is to inspire the next generation of researchers in the North and provide them with the tools they need to be successful. The ADSF fellowship provides support with a monthly stipend during the program.\nApplications will be judged based on the strength of the motivation of the applicant, academic record, and scholarly potential.

This work is deeply interdisciplinary and draws insights and tools from various areas of social science, computer science, statistics, and medicine.\nHe completed his doctoral training under the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Cohn (nonverbal behavior, machine learning, depression) and Dr. Aidan Wright (interpersonal functioning, statistics, personality). He then completed his predoctoral clinical internship at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (inpatient psychiatry, trauma treatment, neuropsychology) and a two-year postdoctoral research fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University under the mentorship of Dr. Louis-Philippe Morency (verbal behavior, machine learning, computer science).\nHe is now an Assistant Professor in the department of Psychology at the University of Kansas, where he directs the Affective Communication and Computing lab and the Brain, Behavior, and Quantitative Science (BBQ) program. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on psychological assessment, data science, and statistics within the department and offers several summer “bootcamp” courses for graduate students and faculty (on data science and machine learning) through Pitt Methods. He is also the developer and maintainer of numerous open-source research software packages (see Resources)."
